This is an open content Chess font with Fairy pieces added.

# The chess pieces

* A is a white upsidedown bishop
* S is a black upsidedown bishop
* D is a white upsidedown rook + bishop fairy piece
* F is a black upsidedown rook + bishop fairy piece
* G is a white upsidedown knight
* H is a black upsidedown knight
* P is a white pawn
* O (the letter) is a black pawn
* RNBQK are the expected white pieces (as per English algebraic notation)
* TMVWL are the corresponding black pieces
* A `+` is an empty black square
* A ` ` (blank space) is an empty white square

Note that the mapping is (generally) compatible with Chess Merida
and Armando Hernandez Marroquin’s other excellent freeware
Chess fonts.

Uppercase pieces are on black squares; lowercase pieces are on white 
squares.

The following text looks like the starting position for Modern Carrera 
Chess (where an upsidedown bishop also has the knight’s move, and the
piece which is a knight on top and rook on bottom is the rook + knight
piece) in the font:

```

```

Note that the font works best on a QWERTY keyboard (since the corresponding
black piece is next to the white piece; e.g. `V` is a black bishop where
`B` is a white bishop).  Uppercase is a dark square; lower case is a 
light square.
